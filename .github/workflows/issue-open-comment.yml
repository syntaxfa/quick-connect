          MESSAGE: |
            Thank you for opening this issue! 🎉

            We truly appreciate your contributions and the time you've taken to share your ideas or report a problem. To help us keep things organized and ensure we're focusing on active discussions, here’s how we handle issues and pull requests:

              - If an issue hasn’t had any activity in the past **year**, it will automatically be marked as **stale**. Don’t worry—this is just a gentle nudge to see if it’s still relevant. You’ll have **30 days** to leave a comment or update it to prevent it from being closed.
              - If no further activity occurs within those **30 days**, the issue will be automatically closed.

            For pull requests:
              - PRs that haven’t had activity in **30 days** will also be marked as **stale**. This is a reminder to provide updates or request a review if needed.
              - If there’s no activity within **2 weeks** after being marked stale, the PR will be closed.

            To keep certain issues or PRs from being marked as stale, we use the **`no stalebot`** label—feel free to apply it where appropriate!

            Thank you again for your efforts in making this project better. If you have any questions or concerns about this process, don’t hesitate to reach out! 😊
