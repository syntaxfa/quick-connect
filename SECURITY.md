# Security Policy

We take the security of the Quick Connect project very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to help us improve the project's security.

## Supported Versions

Currently, the Quick Connect project is in active development and has not yet reached a stable `v1.0.0` release. Therefore, security support is only provided for the **latest commit on the `main` branch**.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Latest `main` commit | :white_check_mark: |
| All previous versions | :x: |

We strongly recommend always using the latest version from the `main` branch to ensure you have the most recent security patches and updates.
