## 📖 About Quick Connect

**Quick Connect** is an open-source, cloud-native, and lightweight platform designed to enhance and optimize your customer engagement. Unlike similar third-party services, Quick Connect is **self-hosted**, ensuring that 100% of your data remains in your control.

### ⚡ The Quick Connect Difference
While many similar open-source alternatives are built using heavier frameworks like **Ruby on Rails** or **JavaScript**, Quick Connect is engineered with modern, high-performance technologies. This delivers a significantly faster, more responsive, and interactive experience for both you and your customers.

### 🪶 How Lightweight?
When we say lightweight, we mean it. You can deploy the entire Quick Connect stack using our [all-in-one](./deploy/all-in-one/deploy/compose.yml) Docker image, which is **less than 30MB** in size!

### 🌐 Live Demo
